# Phonon_hydrodynamics
Phonon hydrodynamics window using Guyer's condition [Phys. Rev. 148, 778 â€“ Published 12 August 1966].

- This Python code is to compute the average three-phonon scattering rates (Normal, Umklapp, Boundary, and Isotope). It can also provide the phonon hydrodynamics window using Guyer's condition. 

- The input files can be generated using FourPhonon software [https://github.com/FourPhonon/FourPhonon]. It requires setting convergence=.false. and four_phonon=.true. to output 'BTE.w_3ph_normal' and 'BTE.w_3ph_Umklapp' files.
